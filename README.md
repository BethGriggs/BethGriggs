### <div align="center">About Me</div>

<div align="center">

I'm a Senior Software Engineer and active open source contributor, with a deep focus on the Node.js ecosystem.

I've been involved in the Node.js project since 2016 - contributing to working groups, leading major releases, and serving on the Node.js Technical Steering Committee. My focus is on maintaining and improving the stability of open source technologies and supporting their communities.

Outside of work, I enjoy üß∞ DIY projects, üå± growing food on my allotment, üé∏ going to concerts and comedy shows, üéÆ playing PS1 games, and üê∂ spending time with my Rough Collie, Laddie.
